### Recursive Functions :
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.

- This makes life of programmer easy by dividing complex problem into simple or easier problems.
- A termination condition is imposed on such functions to stop them executing copies of themselves forever or infinitely.
- Any problem which can be solved recursively can also be solved iteratively.
- Recursions are used to solve complex problems `(until u haven't solved earlier)` tower of Hanoi, Subsequence, Stair Paths etc.


### Base condition in recursion :
The case at which the function doesn’t recur is called the base case.


### Recursive Case :
The instances where the function keeps calling itself to perform a subtask i.e. solving problem by dividing it in small parts, is called the recursive case.


### Summary : 
Now let me summarize whole recursions. So Recursion is a process in which any function keeps calling itself till any termination condition is satisfied and in simple words you can think Recursions as same like iteration because in both of them repetition occurs till any condition is satisfied or becomes false.
 
And the most important thing during using recursions is it’s termination condition because most of time the condition given in recursive function is wrong and because of that the function is executed infinitely or for forever.
